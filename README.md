BreakOut 3D is a 3D version of popular BreakOut game created using Ogre Engine, CEGUI and C++. I developed this game as a part of the Mid-term project for [Game Engine Development class](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~cpresser/cs391/breakout.html) that I took during the Spring Semester of 2015 at Gettysburg  College.  You can find more information about the game as well as instruction on how to build it here:
